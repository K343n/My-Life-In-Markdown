## Favorite Book

Although it may be cheesy, I am huge fan of romance novels, more specifically ones I can cry my eyes out to. I think it's beautiful that we are able to read and experience an amazing and "perfect" love through books. Throughout the course of this year, I have been able to read many novels, but my favorite, by far, was *If He Had Been With Me*. It was a slow burn, but that only made the book better. What made the book standout was the author told you the ending of the story to start the story off. Reading it at first was confusing, but once you get to the end it all connected. In addition, the story was beautifully written. The book is based off of the story of two childhood bestfriends who grew up together, however at one point in middle school, they go seperate and barely talk to each other when their families are together. Although a slow burner, it will leave you crying and wanting more from the story.

## Most Memorable Experience This Summer

My favorite memory of this summer was watching the sunset on the beach with my mom. However, the day really came out nowhere. My mom came home after work and just told me to grab some things and go in the car. The next thing I knew we were at the beach eating some of our favorite fastfood, Chick-Fil-A, watching dolphins swim in the water. It was such a surreal moment because my mom and I were having heart to heart conversations, with amazing music from my playlist. If I had to go back in time I would definetely choose that moment to relive over and over again.

## Future Asppirations

Ever since I was little, I always aspired to become a docotr. For the past years my heart was set on becoming a Pediatric Neurosurgeon. However, over the summer I have recieved a new found passion for fetal development, after I found out my sister (34) wanted to have a baby in the near future. After a summer of very extensive research, I have decided that on top of becoming a Neurosurgeon, I would also like to be a Neonatal surgeon. Although both goals are years away from achieving them, I still continue to have a passion for them.
